  "description": "Every ERC-721 token can store some metadata typically through metadataURI (but can be called other things like contractURI etc). This typically points to a link that stores the metadata off-chain - most commonly IPFS. In addition to this, marketplaces and other NFT providers often have their own API that exposes more information about the NFT that is not stored ‘on-chain’.",
