- [Crypto Coven](https://www.cryptocoven.xyz/) - NFT collection that inspired the smart contract
- [NFT Merkle Allowlists Scaffold](https://github.com/straightupjac/nft-merkle-allowlist-scaffold) - another NFT scaffold that inspired the gas-efficient presale
- [Scaffold ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth) - the OG scaffold that inspired this project's direction
- [Hashlips Art Engine](https://github.com/HashLips/hashlips_art_engine) - generative art tool that inspired the asset generation
